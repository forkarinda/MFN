after you 've done at least six to twelve rounds of sun salutation in sivananda yoga we start on the main practice . we will begin with leg raises . it really helps open up the core , strengthen the core , and it 's just a wonderful way to start . so i 'm going to have lauren here lay down on her back . beautiful . now bring your arms down to your sides , palms on the earth . if you need any little assistance in this , because it is a lot of core work through here , you can place the hands underneath the hips if you need just a little bit of assistance . when i ask lauren here to engage the feet , nice deep flexion of the feet . pressing through the heels , toes to the nose . and we 're going to start with single leg raises , and we 're going to have you do three of each , on each side . starting very slowly , inhaling up the right leg . about five seconds , slowly coming up . exhaling five , four , three , two , one . inhaling up right , five , four , three , two , one . lowering down slowly , five , four , three , two , one .
